    " * because if you use n-1 instead of n, that is sample data of population, it gives accurate result of variance and Standard Deviation.\n",
    " * n is the no. of sample data.\n",
    " * if you have a sufficiently large sample _and_ if you are actually trying to approximate the population mean.\n",
    " * If you’re just interested in finding the sample mean,\n",
    " * and don’t want to extrapolate your findings to the population, just omit the correction.\n",
    " * When you have an entire population and calculate  the population variance or population standard deviation, results will be accurate. That’s because we have all the data about your population."
