## Git command reviews
### Ela use all Git basics and advanced commands. 
* starts from making directory by mkdir command
* git init command and touch command.
* She used all commands clearly with the flow, thats very easy to understand.
* Commands she implemented in Git are, 'add', 'commit','status','branch','checkout' to create file, add to the git and get status, created new branch and swich to the other branch respectively.
* ' remote add origin ' to connect local to remote repo.
* And she used Push,Pull,add,commit cmds without errors so its very useful for further considerations
