## Assignment about functional programming
### Keerthana and Ibrahim Review
* In this assignments they used three functions with Lambda functions.
* A list of Integers on which they applied all the functions(used Filter,Reduce,Map) one by one.
* 2nd assignment was about GCD where they used Math lib for reduce class and applied on parameters.
* 3rd assigment was about decorator. here they use decorator with the function and pass args and kwargs. 
** SOrt the list on the bases of True condition and groupBy the list successfully. 
** code is very clean and clear to understand.
